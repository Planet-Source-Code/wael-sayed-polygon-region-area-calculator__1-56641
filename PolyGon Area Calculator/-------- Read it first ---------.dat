Polygon area calculator

It is an application showing a method of calculating the area of any type of polygon
(Convex or concave)...It doesn't matter...also, it uses two methods of calculations:

1- Recursive method which has never seen to be used before on the net. This is because complexity
   and slowness. I just wanted to try it and see its results. I found it wonderful.

2- Trapezoidal method which is very common over the net. It is very simple and fast.
   I used it to compare its result with the first method. 

Only one restriction must exist: any two non-consecutive sides can't be intersected.

U can save the drawn polygon and re-opining it. if u drew any polygon and u found the results
of the two methods are different, Plz, save the polygon and send it to me on

Also, u can send any comments to enhance my work..I will be pleasant for that....


how to use:


1- run the project.
2- u can open a ready made sample from File > Open menu.
3- u can draw ur own polygon by using the left button of ur mouse to locate all vertices
   except the last one. U have to use the right button to locate it. (the result of the two methods
   will be displayed immediatly).
4- if u want to draw a new polygon just hit F2 or click File > New.
5- U can stop drawing ur polygon before finishing by hitting Esc.
 

Important Issue:

What to do to calculate the area of a polygon which can't be drawn on the form due to its size limitations?
1- Open txt file and save it.
2- In the first line, write the coordinates of the first vertix on the form X1,Y1 then press Enter
   where X1 is X-axis component and Y1 is Y-axis component.
3- In the Nth line write the coordinates of the Nth vertix on the form Cn,Dn then press Enter
   where Cn = Xn - X1 and Dn = Yn - Y1.
4- U have to consider that the X-axis goes from left to right and the Y-axis goes from top to down
   hence the refernce point of the form is on the Top-Left corner.
5- After closing the txt final, run the program then select the file to be opened. You will get the
   result immediatly.



Advantages:

U can use this application to calculate the area of any region contained in an image file (BMP / JPG / GIF)
like a country in a map image file. An example for Egypt map is attached. U will find the polygon file and the
image file attached in the zip file. U can apply this for any country or city map. Just u need a precise map file
and its drawing scale. Take care, more points u locate on the borders, more accurate result u obtain. And again,
u have to take care about the condition mentioned above....


Last thing I want to say:

The result calculated by the application must be multiplied by the unit area according to your drawing scalse.
This is your work......... :-)



Enjoy it!!!!!!!!!!
